        Hello my name is, Alexander Jorel Scott, I was born on May 17, 1997.
        During the time of writing this, I am currently a 3 year veteran on the
        UAB police force. I will use my experience as a Law Enforcement officer
        as a stepping stone to reach for higher goals in my life. I have made it
        a goal to one day become a professional Web Developer/Software Engineer.
        I am currently taking Online lessons on ,Udemy, learning the basic
        fundamentals of coding, using different languages. I will be starting my
        Freshman year of college at UAB in the fall of 2022 to major in Computer
        Science.
